# IOT-Weather-Station
This project features an IoT Weather Station using the Arduino Uno R4 Wi-Fi. It monitors temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, wind direction, and rainfall using various sensors. Data is uploaded in real-time to the Blynk app for easy remote access and monitoring, making it a versatile tool for weather tracking.
